## Download Estimates (.CSV)

We update the database daily (if possible). New estimates are available around 8:00 AM ET. Instructions for the database are available in the README file included in the folder "Estimates-Database".

## Replication Code

See README file for detailed instructions. 

## Source of the Data

The original data are collected by the John Hopkins CSSE team and are publicly available online (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Change Log

* 26/3/2021: We have updated the estimation procedure to (i) use more informative priors; and (ii) allow for intra-week seasonality. With these changes, we get estimates of R that are more consistent with the growth rate of infections seen in each country.
